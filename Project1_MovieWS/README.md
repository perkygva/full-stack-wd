# Movie Trailer Website
by: Allan Perk

This is the first project of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree.

It is a simple script to create a webpage to host movie names, posters, and link to the movie's trailer on youtube by 
clicking on the poster.

# Running the script

Provide a list of movies and run entertainment.py which will download all the information for each movie, including its poster. 
A separate list needs to be provided with the links to each trailer, as that functionality was bugging and not included for the moment.
