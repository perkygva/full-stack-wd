# Movie Trailer Website
by: Allan Perk

This is the first project of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree.

It is a simple script to create a webpage to host movie names, posters, and link to the movie's trailer on youtube by 
clicking on the poster.

## Running the script
Python 3 required!

1. Save fresh_tomatoes.py. "Fork this repository to create your own copy in GitHub. 
2. Run entertainment.py 
3. Additional Options:
  - Movies can be changed by inputting a list of movie titles (name needs to match OMDB format).
  - At the moment, list of youtube trailer links also needs to be created in same order (next iteration will have this automatic).
  
That's it, your website should open with the poster of your favorite movies (or my favorite movies) and you can visualize the trailer's by clicking on the poster.
