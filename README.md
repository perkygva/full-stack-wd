Udacity Nanodegree Projects and Files
by: Allan Perk

## Project 1: Movie Website
This is the first project of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree.

It is a simple script to create a webpage to host movie names, posters, and link to the movie's trailer on youtube by 
clicking on the poster.

### Running the script
Script was developed in Python 3!

1. Download python 3 if you do not already have it.
2. Fork this repo or download the files within the Project 1 folder. (fresh_tomatoes.py, media.py, entertainment.py)
3. Run entertainment.py in IDE or shell.
4. Additional Options included:
  - All movie information and posters are pulled from OMDB database.
  - At the moment, a list of youtube trailer urls is required, but will later be automated. 
  
That's it, your website should open with the poster of your favorite movies (or my favorite movies) and you can visualize the trailer's by clicking on the poster.
